# Job_Market_Analysis
This is an analysis of job market . I have started by importing necessary Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data handling and visualization,  then I proceeded to load the dataset containing job listings and performed data preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis (e.g., handling missing values and formatting columns).

Then conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights. This includes:

Analyzing the most in-demand job titles and top hiring companies.

Visualizing job distributions across locations and employment types.

Identifying frequent skills mentioned in job descriptions.

Using visual plots like bar charts and pie charts to make the trends more understandable and interactive.

By doing this, I have effectively shown how AI and data analytics can be used to gain insights into the dynamic job market and help job seekers, recruiters, and policymakers make better decisions.
